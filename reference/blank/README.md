# Blank devcontainer template

> *A blank template with as many of the key / value pairs outlined and commented as possible.*

---

## How to use

Use the `devcontainer.json` file as a starting point for creating new devcontainers from scratch. 

### The `devcaontainer-template.json` File

Eventually I will have many values populated in this file so that when opening the `devcontainer.json` in smarter programs it will allow you to select items from this template file.
